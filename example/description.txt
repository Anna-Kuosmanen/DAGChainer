This folder contains examples of the file formats used by the pipeline.

The file "short_reads.sam" contains the short read alignments and the file "long_reads.fa" contains the long read sequences.

Files "input.graph" and "input.nodes" are the file format of our graph creation module (traphlor/RNA_MPC_SC/createGraphWithSubpathConstraints.h). The graph creation module also outputs the coverages of the nodes and arcs, but they can be omitted (and indeed are ignored, if they are there, when creating the SequenceGraph objects).

In "input.graph", the first row is the number of nodes. After that i'th (i = {0,...,number of nodes-1}) row tells which nodes are the outneighbors of i'th node.

"input.nodes" contains the genomic coordinates of each node (1-based coordinates).

As the SequenceGraph object requires sequences instead of coordinates, "input.nodes" is transformed into "input.nodes.fa", where first row is the node number, the second row is the sequence. Please note that this file must be sorted by node numbers and the numbering must be consecutive (e.g. not allowed to number the nodes 0, 1, 3, skipping number 2).

SequenceGraph can be written as GFA using the function "outputGFA". An example of the output is shown in "input.gfa". The software VG can then transform GFA into its own format, and further process that format into GCSA2 index.

Please note that the node numbering from .graph to .gfa shifts by 1. This is because GCSA2 indexing does not allow for a node numbered 0.


To test the pipeline you can run

../transcriptPipeline -s short_reads.sam -l long_reads.fa -g <your path to human genome hg38> -o pipeline_test

(If you get an error, check that VG is in your system path!)

It should output the same graph information into the "pipeline_test/tmp/" folder as in this folder (plus the other following information used for running Traphlor).
